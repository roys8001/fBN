Description: This function aims to explore the dependence or causal structure in multivariate function data. The model builds on a dirichlet process scale mixtures in the graphical modelling of principal scores and a data driven approach to learn principal functions. The posterior inference is conducted with Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
