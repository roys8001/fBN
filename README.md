##Intermediate Project Update

Continuously monitoring multiple interrelated variables is routinely conducted in longitudinal studies, constituting a type of multivariate functional data. One critical task is to explore the dependence/ causal structure among the targets of interests. In this package we tend to develop a Bayesian approach to learn semi-parametrically directed acyclic graphical(DAG) models for multivariate functional data. Specifically we allow for deviation from Gaussian process of functions which facilitates unique structure identification and robustness against outliers.
